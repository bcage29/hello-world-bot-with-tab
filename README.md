# Getting Started with Hello World Bot with Tab

A bot, chatbot, or conversational bot is an application that responds to simple commands sent in a chat and provides meaningful replies. The interaction with a bot can be a quick question and answer or a complex conversation.

This is a simple "Hello World" application that has both Bot and Tab capabilities. The bot sends a welcome message when a new member is added, while the tab displays a welcome page.

## This sample illustrates

- How to use Teams Toolkit to create a Teams app with both Bot and Tab capabilities.

## Prerequisites

- [Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) version 5.0.0 and higher or [TeamsFx CLI](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-cli)

## Minimal path to awesome

    1. Login with your M365 Account using the command `devtunnel user login`.
    1. Start your local tunnel service by running the command `devtunnel host -p 3978 --protocol http --allow-anonymous`.
    1. In the `env/.env.local` file, fill in the values for `BOT_DOMAIN` and `BOT_ENDPOINT` with your dev tunnel URL.
       ```
       BOT_DOMAIN=sample-id-3978.devtunnels.ms
       BOT_ENDPOINT=https://sample-id-3978.devtunnels.ms
       ```
    1. Run command: `teamsfx provision --env local` .
    1. Run command: `teamsfx deploy --env local` .
    1. Run command: `teamsfx preview --env local` .

### Deploy the app to Azure

## Advanced usage of this sample

### Add Single Sign On feature

Microsoft Teams provides a mechanism by which an application can obtain the signed-in Teams user token to access Microsoft Graph (and other APIs). Teams Toolkit facilitates this interaction by abstracting some of the Azure Active Directory (AAD) flows and integrations behind some simple, high-level APIs. This enables you to add single sign-on (SSO) features easily to your Teams application.

Please follow this [document](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-add-sso) to add single sign on for your project.
